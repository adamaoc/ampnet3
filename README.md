## 🏗 Build-Time Data Fetching

This project uses a **build-time data fetching** approach for optimal static hosting:

### How It Works

1. **Prebuild Script** (`scripts/fetch-build-data.mjs`):

   - Runs automatically before `npm run build`
   - Fetches fresh data from FlexHub API
   - Generates `src/data/websites-generated.ts` with TypeScript exports
   - Includes fallback handling if API is unavailable

2. **Static Data Integration**:

   - Components import from `@/data/websites`
   - No runtime API calls or loading states needed
   - Data is embedded in the static build

3. **Graceful Fallbacks**:
   - If FlexHub API is down during build, uses empty fallback data
   - Build never fails due to API issues
   - Site remains functional with available data

### Generated Files

```typescript
// src/data/websites-generated.ts (auto-generated)
export const websitesApiData: ApiResponse = {
  /* fresh data */
};
export const featuredWebsitesData: Website[] = [
  /* latest websites */
];
export const getAllWebsites = () => websitesApiData.sites;
export const getFeaturedWebsites = () => featuredWebsitesData;
```

## 🏗 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ampnet3

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3232](http://localhost:3232)

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server on port 3232
npm run build     # Fetch data + build for production (static export)
npm run start     # Start production server (for testing)
npm run export    # Alias for build
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
```

### Build Process

```bash
npm run build
```

**What happens:**

1. `prebuild` script fetches latest data from FlexHub API
2. Generates `websites-generated.ts` with fresh data
3. Next.js builds with static data embedded
4. Exports to `out/` folder for deployment
5. Result: Fully static site with latest data

## 🎨 Portfolio Data

The portfolio uses a hybrid data approach:

1. **Static Data** (`src/data/works.ts`): Creative works like video projects and campaigns
2. **Build-Time Fetched** (`src/data/websites-generated.ts`): Website portfolio data from FlexHub API

### Works Categories

- **Web Video**: Video content and productions
- **Web Advertising**: Digital advertising campaigns
- **Social Media**: Social media content and campaigns
- **Website**: Custom websites with various features (fetched from FlexHub at build time)

## 🔧 Development

### TypeScript Architecture

The project uses a centralized type system:

- **Prefer `type` over `interface`** for most definitions
- **Centralized types** in `src/types/` folder
- **Import types** with `import type` syntax
- **Re-export** all types from `src/types/index.ts`

### Key Components

- `Hero`: Main landing section with brand messaging
- `Services`: Overview of services offered
- `Work`: Portfolio grid display (uses `getFeaturedWebsites()`)
- `About`: Company information
- `Contact`: Contact forms and information

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with:

- Custom gradient designs (`from-teal-600 to-orange-600` light, `from-pink-600 to-purple-600` dark)
- Dark mode support
- Responsive layouts
- Modern UI patterns with glassmorphism effects

## 📸 Assets

Project images are stored in `public/images/projects/` and include:

- Project screenshots and covers
- Company logos and branding
- Portfolio thumbnails

## 🚀 Deployment

### Static Hosting Deployment

This project generates a fully static site suitable for any static hosting platform:

```bash
# Build with fresh data
npm run build

# Deploy the out/ folder to:
# - GitHub Pages
# - Netlify
# - Vercel
# - Any static hosting service
```

### Deployment Checklist

✅ **Ready for Production:**

- Static export configured (`output: 'export'`)
- Build-time data fetching implemented
- No runtime dependencies
- Optimized for static hosting

### CI/CD Integration

For automated deployments, ensure your build pipeline:

1. Runs `npm install`
2. Runs `npm run build` (includes data fetching)
3. Deploys the `out/` folder
4. Has access to FlexHub API during build time

### Environment Variables

**None required!** 🎉

- No API keys or environment variables needed
- FlexHub API is publicly accessible for build-time fetching
- Fully self-contained static deployment
