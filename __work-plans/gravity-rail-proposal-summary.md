# Gravity Rail Website Rebuild — Simple Proposal

_By Adam Moore — AmpNet Media_

---

## What I'll Do

- Rebuild the current WordPress site into a modern, fast, and secure static website
- Design a fresh, professional look (mobile-first, accessible, SEO-ready)
- Restructure services (update logo, remove consulting, combine industrial + rail switching, add track construction)
- Migrate and improve existing content (copy clean-up, headings, images)
- Implement analytics, sitemap, and basic on-page SEO
- Host the site on developer-managed infrastructure with a simple, reliable deployment

## What You’ll Get

- Modern, responsive website (Next.js + Tailwind; static export for speed/security)
- Clean navigation and clear service pages
- SEO best practices (meta tags, sitemap, structured headings)
- Google Analytics setup

## Timeline

- 8–12 business days from design approval

## Investment

- One-time project fee (base scope): **$5,690**
  - Includes: design, rebuild, content migration, SEO setup, analytics, deployment
  - Assumes no CMS; static content managed by me with quick updates as needed

## Hosting & Ongoing Costs (Developer-Managed)

- Hosting + maintenance: **$75/month**
  - Infrastructure and bandwidth: **$25/month**
  - Ongoing maintenance and support: **$50/month**
- Domain management (if desired): **$15/year**

## Email (Current Status Unknown)

- If you already have business email set up (e.g., Microsoft/Google/Zoho), we can keep it as-is and update DNS during launch (no extra monthly from me).
- If you need new email set up, I can handle provisioning and DNS:
  - Zoho Mail: ~**$3/user/month** + one-time setup **$50**
  - Google Workspace: ~**$6/user/month** + one-time setup **$75**
  - Email sending (transactional only, if ever needed): Resend ~**$5/month**

## Assumptions

- No CMS required; static site with periodic content updates handled by me
- Scope covers redesign, restructure, and migration of existing pages/content (no e‑commerce or complex integrations)
- Stock or provided photos; custom photography is optional
- Two design revision rounds included in base

## Next Steps

1. 30–45 min discovery call to confirm pages, content, and design direction
2. I deliver design for approval
3. Build and migrate content
4. Testing and launch (DNS cutover and analytics)
